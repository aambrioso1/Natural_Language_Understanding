# Natural_Language_Understanding

A repository of notes and information related to Natural Language Understanding.   My intention is to focus on large language models and the emerging ability learn from explanations (few-shot prompting).

Here is a set up papers that cover this area:

From the first paper on the list, ["Can Language Models learn from explanations in context?"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02329.pdf)

A new paradigm has emerged in natural language processing: few-shot prompting of large language
models. Such models appear to exhibit some in context learning abilities, such that they can infer how to perform a new language task few-shot from a few examples of input and output pairs within the modelâ€™s context
window, but without training.
